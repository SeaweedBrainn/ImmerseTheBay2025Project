# Live Wire
Live Wire combines the power of Mixed Reality provided by Meta with Afference haptic smart rings to bring the sensation of touch into the immersive XR experiences. This project is a bomb defusal simulator in which users can feel the touch feedback provided by interactive elements in the scene to defuse a bomb by solving puzzles. [Afference rings](https://www.afference.io/#technology) are an excellent source for this exact kind of touch feedback. These haptic rings pass electrical signals into the skin, simulating natural electrical communication in the nervous system providing the sensation of touch.
